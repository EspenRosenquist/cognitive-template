# Copilot Instructions — Cognitive Project Loop

This repository uses the **Cognitive Project Loop**.  Instead of repeating all the rules here, please see `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` at the root of the repository.

In summary:

- Read and respect `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` for goals, constraints, and decision gates.
- Align your work with the Goal Stack in `TODO.md`.
- Provide options, quantify trade‑offs, and ask for approval only at decision gates.
- Draft Exec Plans when triggers apply using `.agent/PLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and do not implement changes until the plan is accepted.

For further guidance, refer to the comprehensive AI instructions file.
