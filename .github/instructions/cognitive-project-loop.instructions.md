# Cognitive Project Loop — Prompt File

Use this instruction file when the user asks for:
- project planning, architecture, backlog shaping, or long-running task management.

Procedure:
1) Restate Definition of Done + constraints from `PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md`.
2) Provide options A/B (and C if warranted) and quantify via `METRICS.md`.
3) Recommend the best option under the current weights.
4) If a Decision Gate is crossed, stop and ask for a decision.
5) Keep outputs incremental (small PR-sized changes).

Footer:
Follow the deliverable discipline footer in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
