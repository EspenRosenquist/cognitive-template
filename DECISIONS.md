# Decision Log (ADR‑lite)

This log records **decisions**, not discussion.  Keep entries short, durable and easy to scan.  Use this document to avoid re‑litigating past choices.

## How to record a decision

Use the following format for each entry.  Add new decisions to the top of the list.

### {{YYYY‑MM‑DD}} — {{Decision title}}

- **Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded
- **Context**: {{Why this decision was needed}}
- **Decision**: {{What we decided}}
- **Rationale**: {{Why this is best under current constraints}}
- **Consequences**: {{What changes; what becomes easier or harder}}
- **Verification**: {{How we validate it works; how we detect regressions}}
- **Links**: {{Issue/PR/Docs}}
