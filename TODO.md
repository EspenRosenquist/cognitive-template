# TODO — Goal Stack and Backlog

This file serves as the active memory of your project.  Keep the Goal Stack short and ordered; use the backlog for items you will tackle later.

## Goal Stack (ordered; keep 3–7 items)

1. {{Goal 1}}
2. {{Goal 2}}
3. {{Goal 3}}

Review cadence: {{Weekly / Biweekly / Monthly}}

## Bootstrap Checklist

Complete these tasks before heavy development begins:

- [ ] Fill out `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` (North Star, DoD, constraints, weights, gates).
- [ ] Populate the Goal Stack above.
- [ ] Capture a brief domain summary or glossary in `CONTEXT.md` (if needed).
- [ ] Create your first Task in a GitHub issue or start an Exec Plan in `plans/` if the work is complex.

## Backlog (prioritised)

Use GitHub issues or a separate project board for your backlog.  Keep this list short or replace it with a link to your issue board.

- P0: {{High priority item}}
- P1: {{Medium priority item}}
- P2: {{Low priority item}}
