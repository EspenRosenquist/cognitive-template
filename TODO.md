# TODO — Goal Stack and Backlog

## Goal Stack (ordered, keep 3–7 items)
1. {{PLACEHOLDER: Goal 1}}
2. {{PLACEHOLDER: Goal 2}}
3. {{PLACEHOLDER: Goal 3}}

Review cadence: Weekly or biweekly (pick one and keep it consistent).

## Bootstrap Checklist (complete before heavy development)
- [ ] Fill out `PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md` (North Star, DoD, constraints, gates)
- [ ] Define invariants in `INVARIANTS.md`
- [ ] Define metrics rubric in `METRICS.md`
- [ ] Define domain context and data contracts in `CONTEXT.md`
- [ ] Create first **Task** issue for the next deliverable
- [ ] If applicable: define minimal test/validation harness
- [ ] If applicable: define deployment/runbook skeleton in `RUNBOOK.md`

## Backlog (prioritized)
Backlog items can live in GitHub issues. Keep this list short or link to the issue list.
- P0: {{PLACEHOLDER}}
- P1: {{PLACEHOLDER}}
- P2: Add optional automation pack (bootstrap check script + placeholder detection + CI reminder)
